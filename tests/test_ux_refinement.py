"""Automated Verification Suite for UX Refinement (PROMPT 26).

Verifies the user experience architecture across all three core front-ends:
1. Citizen Mobile Dashboard (/citizen-app)
   - Mobile-first, low cognitive load, plain language, accessible
   - Large touch targets (>= 48px)
   - Multilingual readiness (en, hi, kn)
   - Direct answers to the 4 citizen questions:
     1. How am I doing? (#question-how-doing)
     2. What changed? (#question-what-changed)
     3. What should I do today? (#question-what-today)
     4. Do I need professional help? (#question-need-help)
   - Immediate next actions & emergency escalate (108, ASHA, PHC)

2. Clinician Copilot Dashboard (/clinician-app)
   - Clinical ergonomics, draft governance, patient switcher
   - Direct answers to the 5 clinician questions:
     1. Who needs attention? (#who-needs-attention)
     2. What changed? (#what-changed)
     3. Why is risk changing? (#why-risk-changing)
     4. What information is missing? (#what-information-missing)
     5. What action should I consider? (#what-action-to-consider)
   - Longitudinal delta comparison & SHAP feature attribution
   - Missing data checklist & 1-click lab orders
   - Clinician review actions (Accept, Edit, Reject, Prescribe, Escalate)

3. Public-Health Command Center (/public-health-app)
   - Population-level surveillance, differential privacy k >= 10
   - Strategic 5-question executive decision navigator
   - Direct answers to the 5 public health questions:
     1. Where is risk concentrated? (#q1-where-concentrated)
     2. Which populations are affected? (#q2-populations-affected)
     3. Are interventions working? (#q3-interventions-working)
     4. Who has not completed follow-up? (#q4-who-not-completed-followup)
     5. What should the program prioritize? (#q5-program-prioritize)
   - Overdue follow-up surveillance & ASHA outreach dispatch batch
   - Top 5 AI policy resource allocation directives
